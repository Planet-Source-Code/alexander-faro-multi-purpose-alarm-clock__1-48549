## Multi\-Purpose Alarm Clock

### Description

Well i don't know if you have seen the movie "Hackers", but when i saw it, i saw a showing program that run at a specific time and completes a task. That's what my program does. You choose the time that you want to run and the task you wish to accomlish (Play a music song to wake you up, run a specific program or shutdown the PC) Well, that's all. Please feel free to mail me at al_fa@mail.gr for any ideas. Please vote even if it is a bad vote.
 
### More Info
 
This Program uses only one .ocx file, the windows media player ocx. (it is included in the zip file, just copy it and paste it on the system32 dir.)
